                                <p>I&apos;m obsessive about working and doing the best I possibly can.  A 5-star rating is pass / fail for me - anything less is a fail, and I don&apos;t believe in failing. There are always solutions when talented people share the same goals.</p>
                                <p>Communication and setting expectations are keys to success. It can be difficult to communicate bad news but it&apos;s better to get everyone on the same page and working together to solve problems.  Silos are a thing of the past.  Time is short, hesitation gets in the way.  Gather information, come up with a plan, execute, and refine.</p>
                                <p>There is a rapidly expanding universe of amazing cloud-based apps that improve the efficiency of business processes, productivity, and collaboration. The teams that learn to harness these will be unstoppable.  But not everyone is tech savvy and the best tools are the ones that everyone is on board with.  Minimize the number of tools you&apos;re using so you have a central point of truth.</p>

I moved there right after the 89&apos; earthquake The internet was new, Cisco Systems had just been founded by a husband and wife team working for Stanford University, Steve Jobs had left Apple to start NEXT &amp; Pixar. How the world has changed. Following are a few of the startups and turnarounds that I participated in.&nbsp;</p>

I came with the idea of converting all of our internal processes, vendor information, data sheets, and pricing to Lotus notes and sold the idea to management.&nbsp; It totally transformed the way we did business.</p>

The created handwriting recognition products for the Japanese &amp; Chinese markets, each having roughly 10k unique character symbols, and no revenue generation.&nbsp; One of the engineers created a simple product where you could write single characters on a screen. I sold the heck out of it to Microsoft, Ericsson / Symbian (I was the first to sell to them), and anyone else with touch based device. We had some strong biometric signature verification tech and integrated it into Adobe, creating the first digital signature solution. I put a team together to license this to systems integrators and large enterprises, We won a major deal with Charles Schwab for enrolling new accounts.&nbsp; Two yeas later, when Palm went public, we were the third highest volume on NASDAQ for a week, and reached a multi-billion dollar market cap.</p>
